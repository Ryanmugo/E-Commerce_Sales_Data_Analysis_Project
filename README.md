 - Monthly Revenue Growth Analysis: Analyze revenue growth trends and patterns over the fiscal year to assess performance and identify key drivers.

 - Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) Calculation: Compute the CLV to gauge the long-term value of customers and their impact on overall revenue.

 - Top-Performing Products Analysis: Identify and analyze products with the highest sales and profitability to understand what drives success.

 - Underperforming Cities Analysis: Pinpoint cities with lower revenue performance and investigate potential reasons for their underachievement.
