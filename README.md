## Strategic Recommendations for Improvement

  ### 1. Shift to Service-Oriented

    -  Adopt a Service-Based Approach: Consider transitioning to a service-oriented business model, such as a subscription-based system. For example, Adobe’s shift to a subscription model resulted in a revenue increase of over 25% year-over-year.

  ### 2. Alllocating Funds for Targeted Marketing

    - Invest in Targeted Campaigns: Dedicate a portion of your marketing budget to targeted advertising on platforms like Facebook and Instagram. Monitor key performance metrics such as click-through rates and conversion rates to assess effectiveness. This strategy could potentially yield a significant return on investment (ROI), ranging from 200% to 300%.

  ### 3. Implementing Promotions and Discounts

    - Boost Sales with Promotions: Utilize time-limited promotions and flash sales to increase short-term sales by up to 30%. Plan seasonal promotions and strategically timed sales events to drive urgency and consumer interest. Analyze sales data during these periods to measure impact and refine future strategies.

  ### 4. Launching Loyalty Programs Based on CLV Analysis

    - Enhance Retention with Loyalty Programs: Implement a tiered loyalty program to increase customer retention by 5-10% and revenue by 15-25%. Structure the program based on customer lifetime value, offering personalized rewards and incentives through data analytics. Regularly monitor customer retention rates and repeat purchase behavior to refine the program.

  ### 5. Focusing on Underperforming Regions

    - Customize Regional Marketing: Tailor marketing strategies to the specific needs and preferences of underperforming regions. Conduct thorough market research to understand local demands and references. Implement localized marketing campaigns and track regional sales growth to evaluate effectiveness and adjust strategies as needed.

### 6. Optimizing Top Performing Products

   - Increase Average Order Value with Bundling: Utilize product bundling to increase the average order value by up to 20%. Create bundles that combine top-performing products with complementary items to enhance customer value. Monitor changes in average order value and continuously refine bundling strategies based on performance data.


## Quantifying Potential Impact:

 ### 1. New Revenue Calculation

    - To estimate the new revenue based on industry benchmarks, we assume an overall increase of 25-30%.

  **Formula:**
    plaintext
       New Revenue = 2019 Revenue × (1.25 to 1.30)

       New Revenue = 684,064.70 × 1.25 = 855,080.88 TO New Revenue = 684,064.70 × 1.30 = 889,283.11

    ```
